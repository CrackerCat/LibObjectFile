LibObjectFile is a .NET library to read, manipulate and write linker and executable object files (e.g ELF, COFF...)

> NOTE: The repository is under construction. 
>
> Currently LibObjectFile **supports only the ELF object-file format**
>
> There is a longer term plan to support other file formats (e.g COFF, MACH-O) but as I don't 
> have a need for them right now, it is left as an exercise for PR contributors! ;)
